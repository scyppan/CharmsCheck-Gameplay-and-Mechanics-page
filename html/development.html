  <h6>Character Creation and Development</h6>

  <p>Character Creation and Development is a rich and complex facet of the game. To ensure the game felt real, rich, deep, and expansive, characters have many options for playstyle, many choices to make, and many opportunities for growth.</p>

  <p>This section will focus on choices that affect stats. Other areas of the game may affect other mechanics, but we'll focus primarily on any choices that affect abilities, skills, characteristics, traits, or subtype bonuses.</p>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> this document will indicate that a character receives certain bonuses each "year in school." These bonuses are awarded at the beginning of the year. In the off chance that a character doesn't complete a year of school, these bonuses should not be awarded. Also note, if the characters do not complete their schooling, they do not get those school-year bonuses. For example, as awesome as they were, Ron, Hermione, and Harry did not attend their seventh year in school, so they would not get those stat bonuses (however, they have other ways to receive other bonuses).</p>

  <p>The greatest period of development for your character occurs when they are in school from ages 11â€“17. The first major decision is about the blood status, with those raised in the wizarding world having gained a little knowledge in some skill area. Those raised in the muggle world gain skills with muggles and personality traits (from their years in muggle primary school).</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Abilities:</strong> You get two ability points to spend +1 per school year. That means there is only a total of 9 ability points available for your entire lifetime.</li>
    <li><strong>Skills:</strong> You get between zero and three initial skill buys (a point to spend in a skill). This is based on blood status. If you were raised in the wizarding world, you get more initial skill buys. If you were raised in the muggle world, you receive fewer. You receive one point for every class you take. As well, you get one point in a skill of your choosing per eminence point awarded.</li>
    <li><strong>Traits:</strong> You receive between zero and four personality traits depending on blood status and parental permissiveness. You never gain any more traits and these never change.</li>
    <li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> You gain eight points to spend on characteristics and gain another 1 point per year in school.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Different schools have different curricula, elective profiles, and course loads. That means that characters from different schools have very different stat profiles. Choose your school wisely.</p>

  <p><strong>Equipment, items, inventory:</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Equipment:</strong> Items you can wear or hold. This typically includes a wand and two accessories. However, for those that come from schools that do not use traditional wandcasting, you may hold a different item in your hand. Each of these items provides stat bonuses only when equipped.</li>
    <li><strong>Inventory Items:</strong> These may contain bonuses as well. These are passive bonuses that will affect your stats even when they are passively sitting in your inventory.</li>
    <li><strong>Flyables:</strong> Equippable items that are only equipped when flying and therefore should only apply when flying.</li>
  </ul>
