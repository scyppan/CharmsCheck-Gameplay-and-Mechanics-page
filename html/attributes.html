  <h6>Attributes</h6>

  <p>Each character has four <em>Abilities</em> each with between four or five subordinate <em>Skills</em>, nine <em>Characteristics</em>, three <em>Parental Values</em>, and between zero and four chosen <em>Personality Traits</em> (selected from a list of twenty‑three). These values represent the roll totals we discussed in the Rolling and Resolution section.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Abilities (4):</strong> The broadest statistics—Panache, Erudition, Naturalism, and Power—represent a character’s magical prowess. Each governs 4–5 specific skills. Each character receives two points at birth and one per school year.</li>
    <li><strong>Skills (18)</strong> map onto specific magical areas of practice and are linked with coursework at the various schools throughout the world. There are many ways to receive permanent points or bonuses to these attributes. These are most important to a character's overall gameplay experience.</li>
    <li><strong>Characteristics (9):</strong> Personality or physical qualities that develop as the character ages. Each character receives eight points at birth and one per school year.</li>
    <li><strong>Parental (3):</strong> Three values that govern certain interactions with the character's parents, especially in early life and while at school. These values are rolled at birth and never change.</li>
    <li><strong>Traits:</strong> Limited number of innate qualities that do not change throughout the lifespan. The character will be born with these and they will never shift. The character receives between zero and four at birth.</li>
  </ul>
