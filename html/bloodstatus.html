  <h6>Backgrounds</h6>

  <p>There are four backgrounds that affect the number of traits versus initial skill "buys" you have during character creation.</p>

  <p>A "buy" is a point one can spend when making a character or when the character is matriculating. Initial 'buys' are the buys one gets when making a character.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pureblood:</strong> +0 Traits; +3 initial skill buys</li>
    <li><strong>Wizard-Raised Halfblood:</strong> +1 Traits; +2 initial skill buys</li>
    <li><strong>Muggle-Raised Halfblood:</strong> +2 Traits; +1 initial skill buys; +10 to Muggles skill</li>
    <li><strong>Muggleborn:</strong> +3 Traits; +0 initial skill buys; +10 to Muggles skill</li>
  </ul>
