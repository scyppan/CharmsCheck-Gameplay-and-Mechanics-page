  <h6>Characteristics</h6>

  <p>There are nine characteristics and you start with 1 in each. Rolling characteristics is different than all other rolls. Instead of rolling a d10 and adding some amount to it, you roll 1d10 per point in that characteristic.</p>

  <p>For example, if you have Strength of 1, you roll 1d10. If you have Strength of 5, you roll 5d10. Some equipment may offer an additional bonus to your roll total.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Fortitude:</strong> Like constitution in other games. Involves a kind of inner strength and overall magical resistance. Some spells, particularly of a controlling type, may be broken out of through the use of Fortitude rolls.</li>
    <li><strong>Willpower:</strong> Involves mental persistence. While similar to Fortitude, it is more focused on cognitive stamina.</li>
    <li><strong>Intellect:</strong> Raw IQ. This isn't about knowledge in a particular subject area—it's about overall worldly knowledge and reasoning ability.</li>
    <li><strong>Creativity:</strong> Involves creative problem solving, invention, or ingenuity.</li>
    <li><strong>Equanimity:</strong> Emotional balance and the ability to manage one's emotions and emotional reactions.</li>
    <li><strong>Charisma:</strong> Presentation and persuasion through natural charm, including social influence and some aspects of romantic or interpersonal relationships.</li>
    <li><strong>Attractiveness:</strong> A general metric of how others tend to view the character’s overall appearance.</li>
    <li><strong>Strength:</strong> Pure human physical strength, not magical strength.</li>
    <li><strong>Agility:</strong> Highly useful. When a spell is cast at you, you may roll an Agility roll as a reaction to attempt to dodge the attack. This is powerful for low level characters, since rolling multiple d10s may provide a realistic chance to evade high-level casts or creature attacks. Agility is one of the three possible reactions to spell casts—the other two being the shielding spell *Protego* and any specific reactive spells that indicate they may be used as responses to incoming spells or attacks.</li>
  </ul>
