  <h6>Skills</h6>

  <p>The first four are casting skills. You'll cast spells to use these skills. Within the spells, some damage can be done. The degree of damage is somewhat linked to the skill utilized.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Charms:</strong> Fairly generalized and utility-based casts. It's the broadest category of casts. Many healing spells are included in Charms. At any given casting ability, damage spells tend to be weakest in this category.</li>
    <li><strong>Transfiguration:</strong> Involves any conjuration, major item-related alterations, or anything that modifies the form or properties of objects, creatures, plants, or humans. Damage spells are rare and typically come as a result of conjuring something to cause the damage itself. The degree of damage at any given casting level is diverse.</li>
    <li><strong>Defense:</strong> Focused on restraint, control, blocking, and shielding. Damage spells tend to cause a moderate degree of damage at any given casting level.</li>
    <li><strong>Dark Arts:</strong> Involves dark magic spells, including curses and blood magic. Damage spells in this skill tend to cause the greatest degree of damage for a given casting level.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Then there are skills that involve utilization of proficiencies. Proficiencies involve doing something in the world that does not involve casting a spell but may require a particular magical knowledge. For instance, knowing how to approach a hippogriff doesn't require casting a spell, but does require knowing what you're doing. As such, one would use a Creatures proficiency to perform the technique required. Proficiencies may seem world-breaking in some circumstances. View the principles on world building to better understand why these decisions were made.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Creatures:</strong> Detecting, identifying, caring for, taming, controlling, or bonding with magical creatures. Also used to extract creature parts in a manner that preserves their magical properties.</li>
    <li><strong>Herbology:</strong> Detecting, identifying, caring for, and growing magical plants. Also used to extract plant parts while preserving their magical properties.</li>
    <li><strong>Arithmancy:</strong> Involves magical detection, tracing, or tracking. When Dumbledore arrives at the cave in the Half-Blood Prince, he can feel the presence of magical forces and protections. That detection would involve Arithmancy. Placing a trace on a word, object, person, or place would also involve Arithmancy.</li>
    <li><strong>Muggle Studies:</strong> Involves any interactions with muggles, especially to control them, evade them, or misdirect/confuse them. Fitting in when in public requires Muggle Studies.</li>
    <li><strong>History of Magic:</strong> A multi-purpose category with proficiencies drawn from historical sources and techniques. Offers a diverse array of uses. For example, a ritual learned from ancient druids could be performed if understood through this skill.</li>
    <li><strong>Astronomy:</strong> Buffing or debuffing through resonance with celestial bodies. Involves identifying transient magical forces in the world based on stellar activity. Represents a stretch from canon—see world building principles for rationale.</li>
    <li><strong>Divination:</strong> Involves readings through various divinatory practices to understand magical portents and use them effectively in the world. Also involves resonance and prediction. Represents a stretch from canon—see world building principles for rationale.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>There are a few crafting abilities.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Potions:</strong> Making most magical potions.</li>
    <li><strong>Alchemy:</strong> Making specialized potions. Occasionally involves proficiencies as well. Despite its complex history, Alchemy has not generated a robust set of proficiencies—see world building principles for rationale.</li>
    <li><strong>Artificing:</strong> Crafting magical objects. Involves preparing the object and then embedding a spell, potion effect, or creature/plant part effect into it. This process turns an ordinary object into a magical one.</li>
    <li><strong>Ancient Runes:</strong> Spellcrafting. A deep understanding of magical incantations, runes, and the links between language, casting, and magical forces allows for the creation of new spells.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Finally, there are passive abilities that allow you to do things in the world, but have no spells or proficiencies.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Perception:</strong> Allows characters to notice things around them. For detecting magical forces, use a straight Arithmancy roll instead.</li>
    <li><strong>Social Skills:</strong> Involves interacting with, persuading, convincing, or endearing oneself to other humans (or magical creatures that rely on human social interaction).</li>
    <li><strong>Flying:</strong> Involves flying, typically on a broom, though other flying objects may be equipped as well. Note: at the time of writing, the database does not yet include a "Flyables" equipable category, but one is planned.</li>
  </ul>
