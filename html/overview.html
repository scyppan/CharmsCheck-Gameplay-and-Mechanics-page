    <h6>Overview</h6>
    <p>Charms Check is a role-playing game set in the Wizarding World, designed for semi-virtual sessions that rely on
        bespoke digital tools for smooth play. A d10 engine and action-based time mechanics break adventures into
        scene-like beats that highlight story, relationships, and exploration while day-to-day school life unfolds
        quietly in the background. Instead of grindy, turn-by-turn combat, players tackle pivotal
        decisionsâ€”investigating mysteries, pursuing personal goals, and shaping major events together. In development
        since 2019, the system has been refined through a continuous campaign and supported by utilities crafted by its
        creator, Scyppan.
