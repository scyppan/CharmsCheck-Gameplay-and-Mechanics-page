    <h6>Rolling and Resolution</h6>

    <p>In Charms Check, there are three primary types of rolls used to resolve actions and events during gameplay. Each
        roll type addresses different scenarios, from static challenges to direct character conflicts.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>DC Checks (Static Difficulty Rolls):</strong> Players roll against a fixed numeric Difficulty Class
            (DC) set by the Headmaster. This type of roll is common when facing predetermined challenges or obstacles in
            the game world, such as climbing a difficult wall, noticing something hidden, or resisting magical effects.
            The player's total roll, including any skill, ability, and other modifiers, must meet or exceed the
            established DC to succeed.<br>
            <em>Example:</em> “The Headmaster sets a DC of 15 for a Perception check to spot a hidden object. The player
            rolls a d10, adds their relevant skill and ability modifiers, and must reach 15 or higher to successfully
            spot the hidden item.”
        </li>

        <li><strong>Set-Value Rolls (Player-created Static Rolls):</strong> A Set-Value roll occurs when a player
            successfully performs an action that establishes a new fixed number, creating a challenge for others. This
            value then serves as the difficulty level opponents must surpass to counteract or negate the original
            action. Typically, these rolls involve casting protective or concealment spells, setting traps, or creating
            magical barriers.<br>
            <em>Example:</em> “A player casts the unlocking spell Alohamora on a magically sealed lock. They roll a d10,
            adding their relevant bonuses, and achieve a total of 26. Now, anyone attempting to re-lock or counteract
            this spell must roll higher than 26 to succeed.”
        </li>

        <li><strong>Opposed Rolls (Direct Contest):</strong> Opposed rolls occur when two characters or forces directly
            compete against each other simultaneously. Each character makes their own roll, adding relevant modifiers,
            and the higher result determines who prevails. Opposed rolls frequently happen during stealth scenarios,
            direct combat, magical duels, or negotiations.<br>
            <em>Example:</em> “One character attempts to hide using their Stealth skill, rolling a total of 14 after
            modifiers. Another character is actively searching using their Perception skill and rolls a total of 16.
            Because the second character’s Perception roll (16) is higher than the first character’s Stealth roll (14),
            the second character successfully spots the hidden character.”
        </li>
    </ul>
