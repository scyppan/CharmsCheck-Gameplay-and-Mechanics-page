  <h6>Parental Values</h6>

  <p>Parental Values may seem counterintuitive in some circumstances. These should always be DC checks (Headmaster sets the threshold).</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Generosity:</strong> Involves one's parent's general willingness to give to their child. If the child wants something that the parents have (but don't need to make a big purchase for) or have access to, you may roll a Generosity check to see if they are willing. If the parent character exists in the database, you may want to roll competing Social Skills checks instead (Headmaster's discretion).</li>
    <li><strong>Wealth:</strong> Involves purchasing power. If a character wants their parents to purchase something, they may need to roll a Wealth check to see if the parents decide to buy it (given their resources and financial philosophies). A Generosity roll may also be required to determine if they are willing.</li>
    <li><strong>Permissiveness:</strong> Involves the parentsâ€™ general attitude toward freedom and openness for their child. Permissiveness affects the number of personality traits awarded. If the parents have low Permissiveness (3 or lower), the child loses one personality point. If they have high Permissiveness (7 or higher), they gain one. Middle ranges have no effect.</li>
  </ul>
