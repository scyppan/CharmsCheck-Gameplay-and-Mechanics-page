  <h6>Knowledge Acquisition</h6>

  <p>Characters primarily learn Spells, Proficiencies, and Potions by reading books. You will read books passively in school and the Character Sheet (v25) will automatically add any spells, proficiencies, or potions to your character sheet for you. Additionally, you may read two books per school year. We may add a feature to read books as an adult, as well.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Knowledge comes into the world through invention or discovery. It's possible that one develops new proficiencies through the use of the core skill (with Headmaster oversight), develops new spells through the use of ancient runes, or develops new potion recipes through the use of potions or alchemy skill.</li>
    <li>Once a piece of knowledge is invented, it should be added to the database. It should also be added to a "book" even if that book is just called "Jillian's Scattered Notes".</li>
    <li>The inventor can teach others. Others can acquire the knowledge by reading the notes/book. Limit the amount of knowledge characters are teaching one another to plausible in-game actions. For example, I choose to take an action in game to show you how to tame a hippogriff.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Do not add any ol' book to your database. You must have some way that you came by it. Examples include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>You purchased the book in a store</li>
    <li>You found it in a library or other bookshelf and took it</li>
    <li>You were lent it by someone</li>
  </ul>
